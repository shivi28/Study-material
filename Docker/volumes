We have volumes in the docker that is used to store and share data on disc

Basically we have two varities of volumes in the disk
1. Persistent
2. Ephemeral

Persistent is the volume that is used to store some permanent data even if container is deleted

Ephemeral is used to store temporary data that is deleted when container is removed or deleted.

No part of volume is involved when we download or upload any image 

## To share the volume in your container

1. create a folder 
2. link that volume to the container using following command
docker run --rm -ti -v /Users/shivani.singhal/sharedfolder:/csharedfolder --name demo ubuntu bash


--volumes-from  cn be used to share data between containers
